        notes: "Papers that rely on seismic data must document the availability of both the raw waveform data and processed data products (for example, receiver functions, shear wave splitting measurements, surface wave dispersion curves, tomographic models, etc.). It is the expectation that raw waveform data underlying papers in G-cubed will be made publicly available via the IRIS Data Management system (described below) or another similar repository. If the data are not available in such a repository, then the authors should make the waveforms used in the study available via a general repository such as Zenodo.  
  
In cases where the waveform data are under embargo (that is, in a period of proprietary use), the data must be made available for the peer review process and the embargo must be removed with the data fully available at the time the paper is accepted. In cases in which there are governmental or other restrictions that do not allow for sharing of the raw waveform data, editors will work with authors to decide on a case by case basis whether the paper can meet the AGU data availability requirements. Papers for which some or all of the raw waveform data are not available must explicitly state that the data are not publicly available in the Data Availability statement. In this case, the editors will determine if the paper meets AGU data availability requirements and can be accepted."
