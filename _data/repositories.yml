        notes: "Zenodo builds and operates a simple and innovative service that enables researchers, scientists, EU projects and institutions to share and showcase multidisciplinary research results (data and publications) that are not part of the existing institutional or subject-based repositories of the research communities. ZENODO enables researchers, scientists, EU projects and institutions to: easily share the long tail of small research results in a wide variety of formats including text, spreadsheets, audio, video, and images across all fields of science. display their research results and get credited by making the research results citable and integrate them into existing reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission. easily access and reuse shared research results.

        notes: "Pangaea accepts any data from earth, environmental and life sciences. When you start the data submission process, you will be redirected to the PANGAEA issue tracker that will assist you in providing metadata and uploading data files. Any communication with our editors will go through this issue tracker. For more details about the submission workflow see our tutorial. Please note: All data and metadata are quality checked, harmonized, and processed for machine readability, which allows efficient and reliable re-usage of your data. Depending on the extent and complexity of your data submission the editorial process and minting of DOI names might therefore take up to 8 weeks.

        notes: "A global database hosting geochronologic and thermochronologic information from detrital minerals. Accepts data from a variety of data reduction programs that are used widely in the various geochronology and thermochronology communities. These programs have features to seamlessly upload data to Geochron, but do require a unique sample or aliquot identifier. You can access these programs under the Data Reduction Software part of the website. Many of these will accommodate legacy data or data not reduced by those programs.
