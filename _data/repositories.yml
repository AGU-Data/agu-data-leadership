        notes: "BCO-DMO is a publicly accessible earth science data repository created to curate, publicly serve (publish), and archive digital data and information from biological, chemical and biogeochemical research conducted globally in coastal, marine, great lakes and laboratory environments. 1.) The BCO-DMO repository provides data management services at no additional cost to investigators funded through the following programs: NSF OCE Division Biological and Chemical Sections; NSF Division of Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Marine Microbiology Initiative (GBMF MMI). In certain circumstances, the office can provide data management services for a fee to investigators funded outside of these programs. Please contact the office at <a href='mailto:info@bco-dmo.org'>info@bco-dmo.org</a> to learn more. 2.) BCO-DMO works closely with individual investigators and data originators throughout the data life cycle, from data management planning support, quality control and metadata assembly, to DOI creation and archive with appropriate national facilities. The office ensures all contributed project data and metadata are in compliance with current funder policies (i.e., NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy, NSF 17-037) and offers investigators the option to embargo data (in accordance with funder policies) until publication. Dataset DOIs are obtained and available once investigators review final curated data packages for publishing. Dataset DOIs, once generated, may be used for scholarly publication and/or funder reporting. BCO-DMO accepts scholarly publication DOIs and can link these to their respective datasets. 3.) Data accepted by BCO-DMO include all project output (observational data, derived and statistical products, analysis code, software and models, and supporting documentation such as reports and calibration information). The office accepts a wide variety of data types and formats, and works to publish a non-proprietary, research-ready, data package available to new research. To contribute data to BCO-DMO, please see the '<a href='https://www.bco-dmo.org/how-get-started'>How to Get Started Contributing > Data</a>' page, located under the Resources tab of the BCO-DMO website."

        notes: "The Marine Geoscience Data System (MGDS) is a trusted data repository that provides free public access to a curated collection of marine geophysical data products and complementary data related to understanding the formation and evolution of the seafloor and sub-seafloor. Developed and operated by domain scientists and technical specialists with deep knowledge about the creation, analysis and scientific interpretation of marine geoscience data, the system makes available a digital library of data files described by a rich curated metadata catalog. MGDS provides tools and services for the discovery and download of data collected throughout the global oceans. Primary data types are geophysical field data including active source seismic data, potential field, bathymetry, sidescan sonar, near-bottom imagery, other seafloor senor data as well as a diverse array of processed data and interpreted data products (e.g. seismic interpretations, microseismicity catalogs, geologic maps and interpretations, photomosaics and visualizations). Our data resources support scientists working broadly on solid earth science problems ranging from mid-ocean ridge, subduction zone and hotspot processes, to geohazards, continental margin evolution, sediment transport at glaciated and unglaciated margins.

        notes: "Archive for rock magnetic, geomagnetic, archeomagnetic (archaeomagnetic) and paleomagnetic (palaeomagnetic) data. 1.) It is recommended that you reach out to the MagIC team (data.curator@earthref.org) in advance (~3 months) to work out the details of your data workflow and upload. The team can work with you to develop or leverage existing scripts to translate other data formats into the MagIC format. 2.) Uploading summary data (as found in tables in a paper), for instance measurement data, is highly recommended for AGU journals and can take less time to upload. 3.) Once your data have been uploaded to your private workspace in MagIC and is ready for publication, MagIC will require a DOI for your paper. Your data will not be made public until the paper has been published. This sequence of events, ensures the data are linked to your paper accurately by both AGU and MagIC. In your private workspace, you will see what the data DOI will be and this DOI is what you should put in your paper’s reference list for the data citation and in the availability statement. 4.) Your data should be uploaded in its final form before the paper is sent to reviewers; they need to access the data along with your paper. MagIC has a “share link” feature which allows you to share the data from one of your private data sets with colleagues, editors and reviewers. People accessing your data via the private “share link” are anonymous. MagIC does not store the identities of who accesses the data via shared links and keeps any IP addresses associated with accessing private data confidential. 5.) The data DOI link from MagIC should be activated by the author at the time the paper is published. Depending on the journal, there may be some delay between when the paper is published and when MagIC is alerted. The paper metadata must be available to MagIC before the author can activate the data DOI. In the event that an author fails to make their data public, MagIC will make reasonable efforts to encourage the author to do so, but reserves the right to make public the data associated with the published paper. Authors are encouraged to correct any errors or mistakes in the dataset after publishing. Datasets are versioned and the original dataset that was published with the paper will still be available by others. Link(s): <a href='https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/help'>FAQ/Help</a>"

NCEI is the United States’s facility established to acquire, process, store, and disseminate environmental data from the United States and other countries. NCEI operates as a component of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NCEI's U.S. data holdings include unclassified data collected by Federal agencies including the Department of Defense (primarily the U.S. Navy); State and local government agencies; universities and research institutions; and private industry. NCEI does not conduct any data collection programs of its own; it serves solely as a repository, dissemination, and analysis facility for data collected by others. A very large portion of the data held by NCEI is of foreign origin. We acquire foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges with other countries and organizations, and through the facilities of World Data System for Oceanography, Silver Spring. WDS (Oceanography) is operated by NCEI under the auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. It is one of the discipline subcenters within the World Data Center System that fosters international exchange of scientific data under guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). Each year NCEI responds to thousands of requests from users in the United States and around the world. NCEI data support research and development in ocean resource development, marine environmental assessment, national defense, theoretical oceanography, ocean engineering, etc. As a service organization, NCEI welcomes inquiries from all potential users of marine data and data products.

While the system assists researchers with multiple phases of data management, the main functions of the system are storing and sharing data. Researchers from diverse fields of study, including biology, chemistry, physical oceanography, sociology, political science and public health, are able to store their data in the GRIIDC system. Through the GRIIDC search page, researchers, policy makers, and the general public are able to search for and download this data. This shared data can be used to address innovative scientific research questions, assess policies and programs, and in educational initiatives. By providing a forum for both storing and sharing data the GRIIDC system increases the impact of scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond for the benefit of society."
