        notes: "Archive for rock magnetic, geomagnetic, archeomagnetic (archaeomagnetic) and paleomagnetic (palaeomagnetic) data. 1.) It is recommended that you reach out to the MagIC team (data.curator@earthref.org) in advance (~3 months) to work out the details of your data workflow and upload. The team can work with you to develop or leverage existing scripts to translate other data formats into the MagIC format. 2.) Uploading summary data (as found in tables in a paper), for instance measurement data, is highly recommended for AGU journals and can take less time to upload. 3.) Once your data have been uploaded to your private workspace in MagIC and is ready for publication, MagIC will require a DOI for your paper. Your data will not be made public until the paper has been published. This sequence of events, ensures the data are linked to your paper accurately by both AGU and MagIC. In your private workspace, you will see what the data DOI will be and this DOI is what you should put in your paper’s reference list for the data citation and in the availability statement. 4.) Your data should be uploaded in its final form before the paper is sent to reviewers; they need to access the data along with your paper. MagIC has a “share link” feature which allows you to share the data from one of your private data sets with colleagues, editors and reviewers. People accessing your data via the private “share link” are anonymous. MagIC does not store the identities of who accesses the data via shared links and keeps any IP addresses associated with accessing private data confidential. 5.) The data DOI link from MagIC should be activated by the author at the time the paper is published. Depending on the journal, there may be some delay between when the paper is published and when MagIC is alerted. The paper metadata must be available to MagIC before the author can activate the data DOI. In the event that an author fails to make their data public, MagIC will make reasonable efforts to encourage the author to do so, but reserves the right to make public the data associated with the published paper. Authors are encouraged to correct any errors or mistakes in the dataset after publishing. Datasets are versioned and the original dataset that was published with the paper will still be available by others. Link(s): <a href='https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/help'>FAQ/Help</a>"
