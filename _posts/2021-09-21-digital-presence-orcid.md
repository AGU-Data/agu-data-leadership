Your Digital Presence is how other researchers and the international scholarly community discover your research online with commonly used open search tools. It is also an important element of Open Science. By making discovery easy for others you help to:

- Increase **Citations** of your work  
- Build your network to explore possible future **Collaborators**  
- Improve your Open Science practices by linking to your research  

What can you do?

1. Learn more about Digital Presence using this [checklist and helpful 15-min tutorial](https://data.agu.org/resources/digital-presence) on our resources page.  Info includes: registering for an ORCID and using your ORCID to link your scholarly research objects.  
2. Turn on Auto Updates for your ORCID. This significantly reduces work to keep your ORCID up-to-date using trusted scholarly services. You only need to do this once. Tell your colleagues. 

Once you are registered and ready to optimize the updates to your profile, make sure you **“turn on” the trusted updates from the publishers**.  There are two right now: Crossref and DateCite. You can also turn on updates from Publons for your paper peer-review activities.  You only have to do this once during your career. 

**Published papers** - Most large and small publishers use [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org) to register published papers with a persistent identifier, specifically a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Crossref also registers other scholarly works, but primarily it is published papers for all disciplines. 

**Datasets** - Data and software facilities use [DataCite](https://datacite.org) to register published data and software with a persistence identifier, specifically a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DataCite also registers other types of scholarly works, but primarily it is published datasets and software for all disciplines. Data and software also use other persistent identifiers, but for ORCID, only DOIs are set up for automated updating. 

**How to do set up ORCID auto-updates for Crossref and DataCite:**  

ORCID has a [blog post](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006896394-Auto-updates-time-saving-and-trust-building) to walk you through the steps to set up the auto-updates. Each trusted connection is a little bit different. Don’t let that frustrate you.  

**Crossref** uses an email. Please note that the [email is generated to your ORCID Inbox](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971293-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-Crossref). A little known functionality. More on the [ORCID Inbox](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953). More info on [why Crossref is important to researchers](https://www.crossref.org/community/researchers/). If you have published a paper and included your ORCID as an author, Crossref will send your ORCID Inbox a note. You can find your ORCID Inbox after you log in, and select the dropdown for your profile where you also find your “Account Settings”. The email will be a request to “add your published work to your ORCID record” and also an opportunity to grant permission for this to be automatic going forward. Once you grant permission by clicking the button provided, then each subsequent update will automatically update your ORCID, along with receiving an email in your Inbox about that update. 

**DataCite** requires you to set up a profile on their website so you can manage the authentication services.  They use a [token to establish the authentication](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006894594-Auto-updates-in-third-party-systems-DataCite).  You can log in to DataCite with your ORCID profile. There is no need to set up a new account. From the [DataCite Profile page](https://profiles.datacite.org), select “Sign In”, select “Sign In with Globus”. Ignore the fact that it says “Globus”.  On the next page, you can pick Globus, Google, or ORCID. Once logged into your DataCite Profile, go to your profile (upper right of your screen), and select “Get ORCID Token”. Once you’ve established the Token, then your ORCID Profile will be automatically updated, along with receiving an email in your ORCID Inbox from DataCite every time there is an update made. 

Please share this with your colleagues and students to make their lives easier!
