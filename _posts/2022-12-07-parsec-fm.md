# Welcome to Your Journey to Open Science!

Each researcher’s experience with Open Science is unique. However, one thing is true for everyone: making your research process and outputs more open helps make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible, and reusable for everyone, to help increase scientific collaboration, creation, evaluation, and communication. 
To get you started on your journey towards Open Science, we have prepared a set of checklists and guidelines for **you as a researcher** and for your **research team**.
## You, the researcher:
– These resources will help you get **recognition** for your work and make sure your work, and your profile, are **visible and discoverable**.
## Your research team or lab:
– This guidance will help you and your team learn to **work openly and collaboratively**.
## Take the first steps on your journey to Open Science
