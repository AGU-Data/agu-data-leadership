# Welcome to Your Journey to Open Science!

Each researcher’s experience with Open Science is unique. However, one thing is true for everyone: making your research process and outputs more open helps make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible, and reusable for everyone, to help increase scientific collaboration, creation, evaluation, and communication. 
To get you started on your journey towards Open Science, we have prepared a set of checklists and guidelines for **you as a researcher** and for your **research team**.
## You, the researcher:
– These resources will help you get **recognition** for your work and make sure your work, and your profile, are **visible and discoverable**.
## Your Research Team or Lab:
– This guidance will help you and your team learn to **work openly and collaboratively**.
## Take the first steps on your journey to Open Science:

1. [Your Digital Presence Checklist](https://data.agu.org/resources/digital-presence) 

As a researcher you have control over how you are represented digitally. Managing your digital profile can help optimize your digital presence, increase the visibility of your work and scientific contributions, connect with potential collaborators and partners, and receive credit when others use your work.  We call this “Your Digital Presence”! Use this checklist and short video for guidance on managing Your Digital Presence.

2. [Data Documentation and Citation Checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062403)
 
The data you create for your research is a valuable contribution to the scientific record. It is important to plan the creation, management, storage, and preservation needed to share your data so this contribution can be recognized. Use this checklist to improve your data management and sharing practices.

3. [Software Documentation and Citation Checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062414)

The software you develop for your research is a valuable contribution to the scientific record. It is important to plan the version control, management, storage, and preservation needed to share your software so your contribution can be recognized and built on. Use this checklist to improve your software management and sharing practices.

## Discover steps for your team to take as they move towards working openly:

4. [Open Science Practices for Teams](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402075)

Help your lab or research team take the initial steps towards Open Science by developing and incorporating Open Science practices in your research workflow. Improve your team’s data and software management practices and learn preservation best practices. Codify these practices in your team’s Code of Open Science Practice.

5. [Open Science Resources and Guidance for Teams](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402270)

Practicing transparency and openness allows research teams and collaborators to work together efficiently and effectively, enhancing the research workflow. Open Science practices can help teams to work together smoothly, even when they’re not in the same room. Ensure your team has access to common resources and guidelines that support collaboration, transparency, and openness.

6. [Digital Objects Open Science Checklist for Teams](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402540)

Developing a preservation plan for your research team will help ensure your research is always documented, data is backed up, and results are reproducible, even as the team changes. Use this checklist to ensure all digital objects created or used by the team are fully documented, preserved for the long-term, and made openly accessible to the team.
