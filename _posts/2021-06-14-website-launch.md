Today, June 14, 2021, we are announcing the launch of the AGU Data Leadership Program website. The website provides the Earth, space, and environmental science community with information on the latest work within AGUâ€™s [Data Leadership](https://www.agu.org/Learn-About-AGU/About-AGU/Data-Leadership) Program as well as highlights and links from other community work around best practices that support the management, preservation, sharing, and citation of data and software. The website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/AGU-Data/agu-data-leadership) and open to community contributions and collaboration. 

In conjunction with this new website AGU has released their new author guidance for data and software. This includes all the general guidance for all AGU authors as well as links to the journal-specific guidance documents.
