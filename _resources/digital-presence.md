Connecting your research to your data, software and institution is a proven way to increase discovery of your work to potential collaborators and partners, and receive credit when others use your work. 

Using persistent identifiers such as ORCIDs (for researchers), Digital Object Identifiers, and RORs (for organizations) are used to make those connections.  Through the checklist and tutorial we very quickly take you through how to optimize those connections.
