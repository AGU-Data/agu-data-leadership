# Citing and Managing Your Data

### Manage your data:

* **Store your data in non-proprietary formats** where possible. Use compression file formats that don’t lose information (e.g., TIFF) and use open source software where possible.

> **TIP:** New habits take time! Commit to incorporating a few changes into your workflow and make a calendar event to check on progress.

* **Adopt standardized file and folder naming** conventions for your files, projects, and groups.

* **Create README files** and keep them up-to-date with a running log of actions and changes. Include basic elements that will help you create metadata for a dataset.

* **Set up automatic backups** for your data and other files.

### Share your data as openly as possible:  
* Plan early where you will deposit your data. This will help you to document and structure your data and metadata for submission. Some repositories have flexible embargo options: upload your data early to save time when preparing publications or other reports.

### Cite all data: 

* **Include data citations in your papers** for your own data and other data you use in the References section, to ensure you give proper attribution and to support reproducibility and transparency.

* **Write a data availability statement** in your publications that describes where and how your data are available. Check links and files before submitting your paper to ensure data are accessible for peer review. 

> **TIP:** Check to see if your journal offers guidance, or use [this guidance](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors) from the AGU, to make sure your data citations and availability statements are complete!
