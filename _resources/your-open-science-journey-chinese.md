# Welcome to Your Journey to Open Science!

Each researcher’s experience with Open Science is unique. However, one thing is true for everyone: making your research process and outputs more open helps make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible, and reusable for everyone, to help increase scientific collaboration, creation, evaluation, and communication. 
To get you started on your journey towards Open Science, we have prepared a set of checklists and guidelines for **you as a researcher** and for your **research team**.
## You, the researcher
– These resources will help you get **recognition** for your work and make sure your work, and your profile, are **visible and discoverable**.
## Your Research Team or Lab
– This guidance will help you and your team learn to **work openly and collaboratively**.
## Take the first steps on your journey to Open Science

### 1. Your Digital Presence 

#### _Connect your research to your data, software, institution, and more!_

Optimize your digital presence, increase discovery of your work to potential collaborators and partners, and receive credit when others use your work.

1. How to establish your personal identifier (‘[ORCID](https://orcid.org)’) that is unique and global. 
2. How to use your [ORCID](https://orcid.org).
3. How to connect your research work [including articles, data, software, and any digital object] to you, using your [ORCID](https://orcid.org).

Use this checklist for guidance on managing [Your Digital Presence](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4706118).[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4706118.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4706118)[Video - 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/bftzPnFdtHk)


### 2. Data Documentation and Citation Checklist

#### _Share the data that supports your research with an Availability Statement and proper citation in the References Section._
 
Plan, manage and share your data.  

1. When and how to manage your data during your research project.
2. How to share your data as openly as possible: determining which data, which repository, which license.
3. How to cite data and help others cite your data. 

Use this [Data Documentation and Citation Checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062402) to improve your data management and sharing practices.[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7062402.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062402)
