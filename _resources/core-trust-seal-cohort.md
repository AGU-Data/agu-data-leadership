AGU is hosting a cohort of data repositories to apply for [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certification as part of the [Enabling FAIR Data Project](https://eos.org/agu-news/enabling-fair-data-across-the-earth-and-space-sciences). CoreTrustSeal certification demonstrates to a repository’s users and funders that they have been evaluated by an independent authority and endorsed for their compliance with the CoreTrustSeal criteria.

* The initial cost of CoreTrustSeal certification application is covered for the first 25 repositories that submit packages and reduced for the remaining cohort members
