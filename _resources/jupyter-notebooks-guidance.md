Jupyter Notebooks are increasingly being used for documenting data science workflows and replicating relevant analyses in research. The following recommendations are available to help guide authors through the process of sharing their Jupyter Notebooks when publishing in AGU journals. Please note that any data used by your notebook must be preserved and cited separately from the notebook to comply with AGUâ€™s data and software guidance.
