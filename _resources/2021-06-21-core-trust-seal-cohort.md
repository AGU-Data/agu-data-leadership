A cohort of data repositories is being assembled to apply for [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) certification as part of the American Geophysical Union Coalition [Enabling FAIR Data Project](https://eos.org/agu-news/enabling-fair-data-across-the-earth-and-space-sciences). CoreTrustSeal certification demonstrates to a repository’s users and funders that they have been evaluated by an independent authority and endorsed for their trustworthiness.  

<u>Conditions:</u>

* No Risk to Join the Cohort
* Repositories specific to the Earth, space, and environmental science community
* The initial cost of CoreTrustSeal certification application is covered for the first 25 repositories that submit packages  

<u>Resources:</u>
