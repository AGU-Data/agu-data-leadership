# Welcome to Your Journey to Open Science!

Each researcher’s experience with Open Science is unique. However, one thing is true for everyone: making your research process and outputs more open helps make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible, and reusable for everyone, to help increase scientific collaboration, creation, evaluation, and communication. 
To get you started on your journey towards Open Science, we have prepared a set of checklists and guidelines for **you as a researcher** and for your **research team**.
## You, the researcher
– These resources will help you get **recognition** for your work and make sure your work, and your profile, are **visible and discoverable**.
## Your Research Team or Lab
– This guidance will help you and your team learn to **work openly and collaboratively**.
## Take the first steps on your journey to Open Science

### 1. Your Digital Presence 

#### _Connect your research to your data, software, institution, and more!_

Optimize your digital presence, increase discovery of your work to potential collaborators and partners, and receive credit when others use your work.

1. How to establish your personal identifier (‘[ORCID](https://orcid.org)’) that is unique and global. 
2. How to use your [ORCID](https://orcid.org).
3. How to connect your research work [including articles, data, software, and any digital object] to you, using your [ORCID](https://orcid.org).

Use this checklist for guidance on managing [Your Digital Presence](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4706118). [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4706118.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4706118)

### 2. Data Documentation and Citation Checklist

#### _Share the data that supports your research with an Availability Statement and proper citation in the References Section._
 
Plan, manage and share your data.  

1. When and how to manage your data during your research project.
2. How to share your data as openly as possible: determining which data, which repository, which license.
3. How to cite data and help others cite your data. 

Use this [Data Documentation and Citation Checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062402) to improve your data management and sharing practices. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7062402.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062402)


### 3. Software Documentation and Citation Checklist

#### _Share the software that supports your research with an Availability Statement and proper citation in the References Section._

Plan, manage and share your software.

1. When and how to manage your software during your research project.
2. How to preserve and share the version of your software used for your research. 
3. How to cite software and help others cite your software. 

Use this [Software Documentation and Citation Checklist](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062413) to improve your software management and sharing practices. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7062413.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7062413)

### 4. Open Science Practices for Teams

#### _Prepare Your Team for Open Science._

Improve your team’s open practices. Codify these practices in your team’s Code of Open Science Practice. 

1. How to encourage open behaviors with your research team such as collaboration, transparency, and working openly.
2. Which responsibilities and tasks to assign for open science. 
3. How to establish consistent communication that facilitates common understanding and flexibility. 
4. What and how to share your digital objects openly.

Use these guidelines: [Open Science Practices for Teams](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402075)  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7402075.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402075)

### 5. Open Science Resources and Guidance for Teams

#### _Equip Your Team for Open Science._

Streamline your team’s research needs with resources that ensure they are as efficient, collaborative and open as possible.

1. How to establish common team resources and digital object registry.
2. How to manage and track your team’s digital objects.
3. How to ensure equitable team contributions to research outputs and provide appropriate credit.

Use these guidelines: [Open Science Resources and Guidance for Teams](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402270)  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7402270.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7402270)


### 6. Digital Objects Open Science Checklist for Teams

#### _Develop a Team Preservation Process._

Document, select, and preserve your team’s research.

1. How to ensure your project files have an effective backup plan in place.
2. Determine what digital objects to preserve and the supporting documentation. 
3. Determine how open and FAIR to make your digital objects.
