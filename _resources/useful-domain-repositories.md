## Domain-Discipline Repositories Useful to AGU Journals

The data that supports the research reported in your paper must be deposited in a trusted repository. When identifying the most appropriate repositories for your data, first, refer to the AGU’s [journal-specific data guidance](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors#guidance). We recommend a repository that specializes in the data for your scientific discipline as this will maximize the probability that the deposited data will be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Otherwise, look to your [institutional repository](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/163716), your computing center, or a [general repository](https://www.agu.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Generalist-Data-Repository-Grid.pdf) (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Science Data Bank](https://www.scidb.cn/en)).

The following is a list of useful repositories by journal:

NCEI does not conduct any data collection programs of its own; it serves solely as a repository, dissemination, and analysis facility for data collected by others.

A very large portion of the data held by NCEI is of foreign origin. We acquire foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges with other countries and organizations, and through the facilities of World Data System for Oceanography, Silver Spring. WDS (Oceanography) is operated by NCEI under the auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. It is one of the discipline subcenters within the World Data Center System that fosters international exchange of scientific data under guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).

Each year NCEI responds to thousands of requests from users in the United States and around the world. NCEI data support research and development in ocean resource development, marine environmental assessment, national defense, theoretical oceanography, ocean engineering, etc. As a service organization, NCEI welcomes inquiries from all potential users of marine data and data products.
