## Domain-Discipline Repositories Useful to AGU Journals

The data that supports the research reported in your paper must be deposited in a trusted repository. When identifying the most appropriate repositories for your data, first, refer to the AGU’s [journal-specific data guidance](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-for-Authors). We recommend a repository that specializes in the data for your scientific discipline as this will maximize the probability that the deposited data will be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Otherwise, look to your [institutional repository](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/163716), your computing center, or a [general repository](https://www.agu.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Generalist-Data-Repository-Grid.pdf) (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Science Data Bank](https://www.scidb.cn/en)).

The following is a list of useful repositories by journal:

### JGR-Atmospheres

**Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) at NASA Langley Research Center** - The [Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC)](https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/) at NASA Langley Research Center is responsible for processing, archiving, and distribution of NASA Earth science data in the areas of radiation budget, clouds, aerosols, and tropospheric chemistry. The ASDC specializes in atmospheric data important to understanding the causes and processes of global climate change and the consequences of human activities on the climate. Text from [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010061).

**Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC)** - One of twelve NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Data Centers that provide Earth science data, information, and services to research scientists, applications scientists, applications users, and students. The [GES DISC](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is the home (archive) of NASA Precipitation and Hydrology, as well as Atmospheric Composition and Dynamics remote sensing data and information. The DISC also houses the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data assimilation datasets (generated by GSFC’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data products (both generated by GSFC's Hydrological Sciences Branch). Text from [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100000036).

**National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)** - [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) (NCEI, formerly National Climatic Data Center, the National Geophysical Data Center, and the [National Oceanographic Data Center](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/)) is the United States facility established to acquire, process, store, and disseminate environmental data from the United States and other countries. NCEI operates as a component of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NCEI's U.S. data holdings include unclassified data collected by Federal agencies including the Department of Defense (primarily the U.S. Navy); State and local government agencies; universities and research institutions; and private industry. NCEI does not conduct any data collection programs of its own; it serves solely as a repository, dissemination, and analysis facility for data collected by others.

A very large portion of the data held by NCEI is of foreign origin. We acquire foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges with other countries and organizations, and through the facilities of World Data System for Oceanography, Silver Spring. WDS (Oceanography) is operated by NCEI under the auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. It is one of the discipline subcenters within the World Data Center System that fosters international exchange of scientific data under guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).

Each year NCEI responds to thousands of requests from users in the United States and around the world. NCEI data support research and development in ocean resource development, marine environmental assessment, national defense, theoretical oceanography, ocean engineering, etc. As a service organization, NCEI welcomes inquiries from all potential users of marine data and data products.

The system guarantees long-term availability of its content through a commitment of the operating institutions. Each dataset can be identified, shared, published and cited by using a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). PANGAEA also allows data to be published as supplements to science articles or as citable data collections in combination with data journals like ESSD, Geoscience Data Journal, Scientific Data, or others. Additional information about PANGAEA can be found at their [about](https://www.pangaea.de/about/), [help](https://wiki.pangaea.de/wiki/Main_Page), and [submit](https://www.pangaea.de/submit/) pages and their [contact](https://www.pangaea.de/contact/) page is available for further questions you may have.

**Research Data Archive (RDA) at NCAR** - [The Research Data Archive (RDA) at NCAR](https://rda.ucar.edu/) contains a large and diverse collection of meteorological and oceanographic observations, operational and reanalysis model outputs, and remote sensing datasets to support atmospheric and geosciences research, along with ancillary datasets, such as topography/bathymetry, vegetation, and land use. Text from [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010050).

**The World Data Center for Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere** - [The World Data Center for Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere](https://wdc.dlr.de/), WDC-RSAT, offers scientists and the general public free access (in the sense of a “one-stop shop”) to a continuously growing collection of atmosphere-related satellite-based data sets (ranging from raw to value added data), information products and services. Focus is on atmospheric trace gases, aerosols, dynamics, radiation, and cloud physical parameters. Complementary information and data on surface parameters (e.g. vegetation index, surface temperatures) is also provided. This is achieved either by giving access to data stored at the data center or by acting as a portal containing links to other providers.
