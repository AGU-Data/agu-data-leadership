## Domain-Discipline Repositories Useful to AGU Journals

The data that supports the research reported in your paper must be deposited in a trusted repository. When identifying the most appropriate repositories for your data, first, refer to the AGU’s [journal-specific data guidance](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-for-Authors). We recommend a repository that specializes in the data for your scientific discipline as this will maximize the probability that the deposited data will be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Otherwise, look to your [institutional repository](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/163716), your computing center, or a [general repository](https://www.agu.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Generalist-Data-Repository-Grid.pdf) (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Science Data Bank](https://www.scidb.cn/en)).

The following is a list of useful repositories by journal:

### JGR-Biogeosciences

**[Pangaea](https://pangaea.de/)** - Pangaea accepts any data from earth, environmental and life sciences.  When you start the data submission process, you will be redirected to the PANGAEA  issue tracker that will assist you in providing metadata and uploading data files. Any  communication with our editors will go through this issue tracker. For more details  about the submission workflow see our tutorial. Please note: All data and metadata are quality checked, harmonized, and processed  for machine readability, which allows efficient and reliable re-usage of your data.  Depending on the extent and complexity of your data submission the editorial  process and minting of DOI names might therefore take up to 8 weeks. **[Earth and Environmental data]**  

**[Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/)** - EDI is an NSF-funded repository accepting environmental research data and relevant processing code. Trained curators assist researchers from field stations, individual laboratories, and research projects of all sizes and actively promote and enable curation and re-use of environmental data through outreach and training. EDI is committed to enable data that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable through rich science metadata and assigning of DOIs. All data and metadata are quality checked and machine readable ensuring reliable reuse of data. [Data submission](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/welcome/submit-data/) is provided. **[Earth and Environmental data]**

**[Ameriflux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/)** -The AmeriFlux Network ensures the availability of the continuous, long term ecosystem measurements necessary to build effective models and multisite syntheses, while maximizing insight through robust, site-specific, independent research programs. With these consistent, high-quality environmental  measurements, AmeriFlux helps ensure that critical decisions are supported by the most complete understanding and data. Independent scientists measure the flows of carbon between land and atmosphere, using a technique called eddy covariance, and then contribute their data to the AmeriFlux Network. The AmeriFlux Network works with scientists to standardize, quality check, and process data into common forms that the scientific community can use to examine crucial linkages between ecosystem processes and climate responses.

The **[Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO)](https://www.bco-dmo.org/)** - BCO-DMO is a publicly accessible earth science data repository created to curate, publicly serve (publish), and archive digital data and information  from biological, chemical and biogeochemical research conducted globally in  coastal, marine, great lakes and laboratory environments.  

- The BCO-DMO repository provides data management services at no additional  cost to investigators funded through the following programs: NSF OCE Division  Biological and Chemical Sections; NSF Division of Polar Programs Antarctic  Organisms & Ecosystems; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Marine  Microbiology Initiative (GBMF MMI). In certain circumstances, the office can  provide data management services for a fee to investigators funded outside of  these programs. Please contact the office at info@bco-dmo.org to learn more.  
- BCO-DMO works closely with individual investigators and data originators  throughout the data life cycle, from data management planning support, quality  control and metadata assembly, to DOI creation and archive with appropriate  national facilities. The office ensures all contributed project data and metadata  are in compliance with current funder policies (i.e., NSF OCE Sample and Data  Policy, NSF 17-037) and offers investigators the option to embargo data (in  accordance with funder policies) until publication. Dataset DOIs are obtained and  available once investigators review final curated data packages for publishing.  Dataset DOIs, once generated, may be used for scholarly publication and/or  funder reporting. BCO-DMO accepts scholarly publication DOIs and can link  these to their respective datasets.  
- Data accepted by BCO-DMO include all project output (observational data,  derived and statistical products, analysis code, software and models, and  supporting documentation such as reports and calibration information). The  office accepts a wide variety of data types and formats, and works to publish a  non-proprietary, research-ready, data package available to new research. To  contribute data to BCO-DMO, please see the "_[How to Get Started Contributing >Data](https://www.bco-dmo.org/how-get-started)_" page, located under the Resources tab of the BCO-DMO website. **[Water / Hydrologic data]**
