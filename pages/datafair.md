## Town Halls
We’re hosting several Town Halls with updates and discussion on exciting projects in open science and data! 

**[Principles and Responsibilities for Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Earth, Space, and Environmental Science-Focused Research](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetin)** (TH13G)  
12 December, 12:45 CT (18:45 UTC), S105bc McCormick Place (South, Level 1)

AGU is engaging a multi-discipline group of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) stakeholders and others to develop a set of principles and responsibilities for using AI and ML in Earth, space, and environmental science-focused research. The goal is for these principles to be endorsed and adopted by organizations and institutions within the Earth, space, and environmental science community, and used to update or inform general Scientific Code of Conduct policies. In this session we report on the effort and leave time for discussion.

**[Open Science Realities: How Open is Open?](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm22/meetingapp.cgi/Session/161143)** (TH43G)  
15 December, 12:45 CT (18:45 UTC), S103cd McCormick Place (South, Level 1)

Open science is transformative, removing barriers to sharing science and increasing reproducibility and transparency. The benefits of open science are maximized when its principles are incorporated throughout the research process, through working collaboratively with community members and sharing data, software, workflows, samples, and other aspects of scientific research openly where it can be reused, distributed, and reproduced. However, the paths toward Open Science are not always apparent, and there are many concepts, approaches, tools to learn along the way. In this session, we will hear from AGU community members with a wide range of experiences across open science practices. They’ll share the first steps researchers can take in their open science journey and how to best incorporate some or all open science principles in your research, even if you’re just beginning to open up.
